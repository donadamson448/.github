### 💡 My Approach to Development  
I believe in writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. I’m a strong advocate for test-driven development (TDD) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices. Collaboration and communication are key to my workflow, and I enjoy working in agile environments where feedback is valued.  

### 🌱 What I’m Learning  
I’m currently diving deeper into **Rust** and exploring its potential for building high-performance systems. I’m also experimenting with **WebAssembly (Wasm)** to push the boundaries of web development.
